# Password_Generator
Homework 3 for the BCS Full Stack bootcamp

This assignment was to use javascript to write a program that would generate a password based on the users input criteria, and make that program function on an existing, provided html webpage. 

I began the assignment by writing out a basic logic flow in a note document on my phone, outlining my plan for pulling and combining random characters.

I then converted that logic flow into actual code on a practice .js file (one of the in-class activity webpages), using what I had learned in class. I tweaked it using the console to check my outputs until the function I created was working.

Finally I copied the function from my practice file into the script.js for the project, renamed the function so it would link properly with the existing code, and created a loop on the password length entry field to ensure a valid input was received. 

This was fun!
